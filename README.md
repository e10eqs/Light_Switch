# Light Switch

The light switch project was created to control light switches remotely. This project utilized an ESP32 hosting a webpage on its IP address and servo motors controlling the positions of the light switches. Making the 3D printed parts was very key to this project since the switches needed to be flippable without the servo motors interfering.
